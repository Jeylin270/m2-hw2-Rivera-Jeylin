    <h1>Welcome to Jeylin's Personal Webpage</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a dedicated and passionate person. I love learning and it is my life's philosophy that there is always something new to learn and that learning never stops. I am one of four children, I have an older sister and two younger brothers. Growing up in a Hispanic household, I had to grow a thick skin because one thing about my family is that we show love by roasting each other. After being told that I look like the turtle creatures from the first Ice Age movie, I knew that nothing else could ever hurt me.</p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>I love reading, writing, playing instruments, playing video games, going to the beach, eating at different restaurants, watching relaity TV, sitcoms and rom-coms. When I crave for soemthing else, I tend to pick up different hobbies like journaling, crocheting, or whatevr else piques my interest.</p>

<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing a career in marketing and in order to feel successful I want to obtain a PhD. Next, I'll hone as many skills as I can to be the best in my field. I want to be known as an expert in my field, so I'm learning and practicing as much as I can. Finally, since my career is in marketing I want to be the CMO of a fortune 500 company.</p>
